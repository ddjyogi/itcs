Traditional consulting firms have been great contributors to modern management. Their powerful ideas and immense subject knowledge have solved business problems in a legendary manner and also driven up the worth of consultants across the business world. Consultants are generally regarded as expensive. Some agree to the fact that their ideas and solutions are of real help but those who don’t think so, regard them as ‘overrated professionals’. After the recession, most businesses are looking for consulting firms that can provide an end-to-end solution to their problems.\n

Mo more do they want consultants that would woo them with their analysis and models. Instead, they wanted a one-stop solution to their problem, meaning consulting firms who could identify, strategize, implement their strategies and make them operational. Moreover, there has been a perpetual reluctance among business houses on the disclosure of information front. Businesses want secrecy of their information, which is why they are reluctant to hire many outsiders. Added to that is the problem of price for consulting services, which is generally very high. Cost cutting firms thus wanted quality consulting services at cheaper prices. We at ValeurHR identify these problems and work on the nature of the issues through our expert consultation to buyout the advantage of creating long term relationships with clients. We have always been acknowledged as a trusted partner as we realize that we could provide bundled consulting services to the clients at best prices. Combining each of the consulting elements, we embark on the journey towards the ‘valley of the brains’ which essentially means intruding into the arena that the traditional heavyweight problems had been controlling.
