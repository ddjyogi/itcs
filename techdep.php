                        <p>Here’s the rundown of how you benefit.</p>
                        <div class="col-12">
                            <h3><strong>Discovery Sessions</strong></h3>
                            <p>Many people have ideas about changes they want to make to their IT Infrastructure. Yet, how do you know what is possible and, more
                            important, how much it is likely to cost? You are offered the unique opportunity to undertake a <strong>complementary 2-3 hour Discovery Session</strong> where you can air all the
                        questions you might have about a project prior to proceeding with it. This will give you a thorough understanding of what is involved and
                        what your IT road map could look like without the &quot;strings&quot; of going ahead.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Risk Management and Data Recovery</strong></h3>
                            <p>Companies often view risk management as a defensive tactic, rather than an integral part of their IT strategy. Risk management will be
                            integrated into your IT environment, thereby preventing problems before they arise.  Should an emergency situation occur, you&#39;ll have a
                            fall-back plan ready to roll.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Project Management</strong></h3>
                            <p>Implementing changes to your business IT environment is exciting - but can be a bit of an uphill battle! The outcome of a project depends on
                            how well the project was managed. Our IT Consultants look after the entire project and liaise with third party contractors. This gives you the
                            necessary time to focus on running your business.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Business Process</strong></h3>
                            <p>There is a wide variety of SaaS (software as a service) products on the market that can enhance your business processes. Understanding
                            which one will work for you can be time consuming. If you make the wrong call, it can be a costly exercise. Our IT Consultants have had a lot
                            of exposure to a variety of business types which allows us to help you make the best decision.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Conceptual Solutions</strong></h3>
                            <p>Do you have a great idea, a vision, but you’re not sure where to start? Brainstorm with our IT Consultants and turn your amazing concepts
                            into reality using our technical expertise and partnerships.</p>
                            <h3><strong>System Implementation</strong></h3>
                            <p>It’s a complex task to bring in new hardware or software to your current IT environment. We can procure the solution and implement
                            while ensuring your business operates smoothly without interrupting your day-to- day activities.</p>
